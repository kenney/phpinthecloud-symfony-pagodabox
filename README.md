PHP In the Cloud - Boston Startup School
========================

This is a simple PHP application used as a demo for a presentation at the 2012 Boston Startup School.

The basis of this PHP project is the Symfony framework.  Bootstrap has been included for basic styling.

A PagodaBox Boxfile and basic .htaccess has been included for easy launching on the PagodaBox platform as a service (PaaS).
